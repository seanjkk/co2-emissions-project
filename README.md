# Our World in Data CO2 Project

- The Jupyter notebook can be opened [here](analysis.ipynb).
- The Tableau dashboard can be opened [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/OWIDco2data/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### Introduction

Global warming has always been a looming threat to the world. However, as the effects of climate change have become increasingly apparent, there is now greater pressure on countries to immediately take action and reduce emissions. Through this project, I hope to examine the carbon dioxide emissions of all countries from the years 1950 - 2020.

### The Dataset

The dataset I will be using is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/owid/co2-data).

### Objectives

- Use Pandas to prepare the dataset for analysis
- Create graphical visualizations using Matplotlib
- Create a Tableau dashboard with more visualizations
