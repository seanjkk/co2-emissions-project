### Introduction

Global warming has always been a looming threat to our planet. However, as the effects of climate change have become increasingly apparent these past years, there is now greater pressure on countries to immediately take action and reduce emissions. In this project, I will examine the carbon dioxide emissions by country over the years of 1950 - 2020.

### The Dataset

The dataset I will be using is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/owid/co2-data).

### Objectives

- Use Pandas to prepare the dataset for analysis
- Create graphs using Matplotlib
- Create an interactive Tableau dashboard
